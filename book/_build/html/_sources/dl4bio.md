# Zero-Code Deep-Learning for Bioimage Analysis

## Training from scratch

[**Start Google Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dasv74/workshops/blob/main/Streamlined_ZeroCostDL4Mic/MultilabelSegmentation_2D_Unet/Streamlined_U-Net_2D_Multilabel_ZeroCostDL4Mic.ipynb)


## Datasets


Here is a "note" directive:

```{note}
Here is a note
```

It will be rendered in a special box when you build your book.

Here is an inline directive to refer to a document: {doc}`markdown-notebooks`.


## Citations

You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. For example,
the following syntax: `` {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014` `` will render like
this: {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014`.

Moreover, you can insert a bibliography into your page with this syntax:
The `{bibliography}` directive must be used for all the `{cite}` roles to
render properly.
For example, if the references for your book are stored in `references.bib`,
then the bibliography is inserted with:

```{bibliography}
```
