## Zero-Code Deep-Learning for Bioimage Analysis

The goal of the workshop is to give a step-by-step guide to build a robust deep neural network for 2D semantic segmentation, enabling participants to apply key concepts of deep learning, without the need for coding skills. For this purpose, we will use a streamlined version of ZeroCostDL4Mic to illustrate the essential components, from data preparation to analysis of results, including the training on Google Colab. The model is tested of Fiji through the plugin deepImageJ.
